<H4>Meditating on God's word, increasing our faith, and filling our minds and hearts with Jesus</H4>
<div>"The heavens declare the glory of God, and the expanse proclaims the work of His hands." Psalm 19:1</div> 
<div>Welcome to my tiny corner of the world, a place where I hope you will find inspiration and encouragement. 
"Breadcrumbs" are daily scriptures taken from God's holy word. In Matthew 4:12, Jesus explains, "Man should not live on bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God." 
And in Psalm 119:105, King David proclaims, "Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. God's word is full of power. For the believer, it is a living force that sustains us and guides us daily.
The commentary that follows the daily verses helps us understand what spiritual truths scriptures reveal, oftentimes opening our eyes to God's character and His great love for us. Finally, the reflection poses questions to help us apply the scriputre to our lives so that we may walk out God's truths daily.</div></td>

 <blockquote>"Thus says the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker;<br>
 '<i>Ask Me</i> of things to come concerning My sons;<br>
 and concerning the   My hands, you <i>command Me</i>.'" Isaiah 45:11</blockquote>
 <p><b>God invites us to <i>ask</i> Him, which is reflective of an ongoing conversation.
He tells us to <i>command</i> Him to act, which shows he has given us authority. Our prayers need not be prayers of hesitancy and uncertainty.
 We can approach God with the comfortand boldness in which we would approach a dear friend.</b></p>

 <div class="box-3">
 <p>How do you approach God in prayer? Do you have any repetitious prayers that are full of doubt and unbelief?</p>
